				<h1>When did you become interested in design?</h1><br>
				<h2>Around the age of 6, I remember watching my Dad play SimCity and being so excited by the colors,
					sound, and interactivity. The importance here cannot be understated- the experience of playing and
					designing functioning cities was what first genuinely excited me about technology, utility, and
					design. By the time I had my own computer- I began building Homestead websites, designing album
					covers, digging through AltaVista and playing [RPG] forum games.</h2>

				<h1>What is your background?</h1><br>
				<h2>Uprooting and starting over has always been a constant theme. At the age of 16 I began working and
					ventured out on my own. As I grew older, I frequently relocated throughout the country causing my
					passion for technology to fall by the wayside. In retrospect, this helped me to understand that
					failures are opportunities to iterate and problem solve. I learned to embrace shortcomings and
					unfamiliarity. I've come to understand that these events were never actual setbacks but a chance to
					reiterate, improve, and strive toward my goals.</h2>

				<h1>How does this relate to your design process?</h1><br>
				<h2>Until now, I have been satisfied with writing, drawing, and designing as a hobby. I learned how to
					cook at a young age and realized I enjoy creating dishes and making people happy. For a period of
					time, I focused my career on doing just that. There are many traits that developed throughout this
					time that are worth mentioning, but the most important takeaway was how much cooking and service
					work correlate with the User Experience. In short, from food-pairings and recipe writing to community outreach and
					product branding, I started seeing these connections and how design is applicable to my other
					interests in life. Beginning my first UX projects, I started to notice these patterns all around me.
					From a blank artboard to an empty apartment or full pantry- it’s the placement of objects and the
					way colors affect mood- it’s in the size of a space and how to design for efficiency & purpose.</h2>

				<h1>What are your goals as a designer?</h1><br>
				<h2>
					As a designer, I value a minimalistic aesthetic and utilize a combination of geometry and natural patterns in my designs. 
					I strive for efficiency through building sustainable and easy to use products for all users and customers. 
					 I'm driven by utility and purpose, to contrast and find value in opposing ideas.
					While beauty and truth may be subjective - it’s the area between aesthetic and utility where I balance
					my world-view and future ambitions.</h2>
