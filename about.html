When did you become interested in design?

Around the age of 6, I remember watching my Dad play SimCity and being so excited by the colors,
sound, and interactivity. The importance here cannot be understated- the experience of playing
and designing functioning cities was what first genuinely excited me about technology, utility,
and design. By the time I had my own computer- I began building Homestead websites, designing
album covers, digging through AltaVista and playing [RPG] forum games.



“The idea that growth happens outside of your comfort zone...”



What is your background?

Uprooting and starting over has always been a constant theme. At the age of 16 I began working
and ventured out on my own. As I grew older, I frequently relocated throughout the country
causing my passion for technology to fall by the wayside. In retrospect, this helped me to
understand that failures are opportunities to iterate and problem solve. I learned to embrace
shortcomings and unfamiliarity. I've come to understand that these events were never actual
setbacks but a chance to reiterate, improve, and strive toward my goals.


“...it’s in the size of a space and how to design for efficiency & purpose.”


How does this relate to your design process?

Until now, I have been satisfied with writing, drawing, and designing as a hobby. I learned how
to cook at a young age and realized I enjoy creating dishes and making people happy. For a period
of time, I focused my career on doing just that. There are many traits that developed throughout
this time that are worth mentioning, but the most important takeaway was how much cooking and
service work correlate with the User Experience.  In short, from food-pairings to community
outreach and product branding, I started seeing these connections and how design is applicable
to my other interests in life. Beginning my first UX projects, I started to notice these patterns
all around me. From a blank artboard to an empty apartment or full pantry- it’s the placement of
objects and the way colors affect mood- it’s in the size of a space and how to design for efficiency
& purpose.


What are your goals as a designer?
As a designer, I value a minimalist aesthetic utilizing geometry, symbolism, and the perfection
of natural patterns. I want to provide this support with the efficiency of geodesic domes
designed with a strong sustainability focus. Finding my heart genuinely rings when helping
others- it is the disadvantaged, under-resourced and mental health clients that I am focused
on working with. In essence, I'm driven by the idea of having a calculated reason why something
 is visually attractive. While art and truth may be subjective - it’s the area between aesthetic
  and utility where I balance my world-view and ambitions for the future.
