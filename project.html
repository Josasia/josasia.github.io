            <p>In hindsight, the intensive critique and user testing was the
               most influential step in this process. I received detailed,
               invaluable input that left me feeling lost, unsure how to move forward.
               My design was completely off-track visually. I created a
               design that was not only unattractive - but also dated, bloated
               and had no real structure or pattern. Understanding that
               failure is an invaluable lesson in design, I took this misstep
               as a means to improve my product and brand.
               As the process is never straightforward and perfect,
               sharing these many iterations is tantamount to showing the
               final product. I’ve included each frame in sequential order
               to guide you through these intensive iterations.

            <p>With some peer input and evaluating my process until this point,
               I found where I began to stray. Thinking the simplicity would
               make it easy to navigate- with bold colors and style being
               “attractive to all”- I pigeonholed myself as I was designing
               with childlike ideas. In attempting to make a sleek, minimalist
               design - I ended up making a cartoon.
               These downfalls are very apparent in my initial Logo,
               Style Guide and Hi-Fi Mockups so I began to backtrack
               through each step of my research and architecture to
               re-evaluate my scope and strategy. Reviewing all of my research,
               the base was strong  but the branding and application
               required a complete overhaul.

               while also being individual pieces contributing to the whole.

         <p>In conclusion, this project has taught me invaluable lessons in the
            design process and the importance of intensive iteration and being
            able to shift gears at a moments notice. As I continue forward, to
            find the right collaborators and fully launch it into the public
            field- this project’s scope is synonymous with mine as a Designer.
            The purpose of providing the disadvtanged and underpriveledged users
            a Cloud format that is easy to learn, subsequently helping them understand
            and have confidence using new technological resources.
