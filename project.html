            <p>In hindsight, the intensive critique and user testing was the
               most influential step in this process. I received detailed,
               invaluable input that left me feeling lost, unsure how to move forward.
               My design was completely off-track visually. I created a
               design that was not only unattractive - but also dated, bloated
               and had no real structure or pattern. Understanding that
               failure is an invaluable lesson in design, I took this misstep
               as a means to improve my product and brand.
               As the process is never straightforward and perfect,
               sharing these many iterations is tantamount to showing the
               final product. I’ve included each frame in sequential order

               make it easy to navigate- with bold colors and style being
               “attractive to all”- I pigeonholed myself as I was designing
               with childlike ideas. In attempting to make a sleek, minimalist
               design - I ended up making a cartoon.
               These downfalls are very apparent in my initial Logo,
               Style Guide and Hi-Fi Mockups so I began to backtrack
               through each step of my research and architecture to
               re-evaluate my scope and strategy. Reviewing all of my research,
               the base was strong  but the branding and application
               required a complete overhaul.

            <h2>BRANDING</h2>
            <p>Starting to revise, sticking to the idea of minimalism and familiarity,
               the first step was to revise the entire style guide.

            <h1>CACHÉ</h1>
            <p>Changed the name to Caché.
               The idea was to represent storage, collaboration and accessibility for all.
            </p>
            <img src>
            <h1>TYPOGRAPHY</h1>
            <p>Add Roboto as  main typography.  A very simple, recognizable, and familiar.</p>
            <img src>
            <h1>PALETTE</h1>
            <p>Mute color palette to a mono- chromatic blue. Accents of white, grey, and black.</p>
            <img src>
            <h1>CALL TO ACTION</h1>
            <p>Call to Action more standard - an outline icon, and outline rectangle.</p>
            <img src>
            <h1>LOGO</h1>
            <p>The new logo was to be more complete and less of an icon.  With the
               letters of Caché being part of the globe expanding toward the user-
               while also being individual pieces contributing to the whole.
               Made Western and Eastern hemisphere variations to be relative for
               users’ location. Logo eventually comes full circle and is finally just simplified typography.

         <p>In conclusion, this project has taught me invaluable lessons in the
            design process and the importance of intensive iteration and being
            able to shift gears at a moments notice. As I continue forward, to
            find the right collaborators and fully launch it into the public
            field- this project’s scope is synonymous with mine as a Designer.
            The purpose of providing the disadvtanged and underpriveledged users
            a Cloud format that is easy to learn, subsequently helping them understand
            and have confidence using new technological resources.
