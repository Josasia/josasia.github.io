        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>As connections get faster and innovation continues forward, technological
          skills increase in demand. With progression comes many brands offering a
          variety of services, this results in many users feeling unskilled and left
          behind.  Cache is a Cloud service designed specifically for users that
          compete with technological or resource disadvantages.</p>

        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
          <p>Finding a niche is necessary when competing in such a crowded climate.
            My strategy was to find the core features that everyday users need,
            then offer these features in a minimal and easy-to-use interface.
            The scope was a Cloud that is industry standard, yet simple and efficient
            enough for all users; to inspire confidence navigating new technologies.</p>

        <h2>INSIGHTS</h2>
          <p>The biggest lesson learned designing Cache was the importance of intensive
            iteration and user testing. While deep into the project, I was met with
            roadblocks of spotty research and missteps. I learned to take this failure
            as invaluable information and a means to improve, exemplifying the
            importance of multiple iterations and embracing shortcomings.</p>

          <p>Research began with a SWOT analysis comparing leading Cloud brands.
          Many features shared between these brands, the most common user needs,
          and a MVP begin to take structure.</p>
